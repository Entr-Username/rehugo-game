Made for school
*Everything* by me, minus the hit sound effects (cough cough Bambi phone breaking..)

I really appreciate the amount of positive feedback this got, considering the fact that I didn't get **any** sleep the night before. Surprisingly my energy levels felt normal later that night.
Pulling the all-nighter was definitely worth it (for the first time ever too).

Other than the fact that I got only 30 minutes of sleep, the days following up to the day I presented were genuinely miserable. Not because I had to work on the project, but because I was physically, emotionally, and socially unable to. Pressure from my mom other classwork, the computer being occupied by my older sister (or her not being home yet - meaning the computer was also gone), other stressful stuff going on..
In my opinion, I thought the game was flawed, inadequate; I focused a lot on the animation bugs/general bugs so ultimately there weren't many mechanics or features. Despite this, my class was surprised and astonished from just the sight of it, and *I* was surprised from their surprise!
This day was a total turn-around. So I will admit one thing, the reactions from the class were overwhelming, I *was* actually holding back tears. This is not at all in a bad way, obviously. I'm just very grateful for my teacher, for the extension, for the fact that she'll use it as an example, and for the extra credits because I used my own music in this.

All of it really brought up my spirits.


(ORIGINAL) STORYLINE / MECHANICS:
Singleplayer story, multiplayer freeplay.
You play as a stickguy that has crazy anger issues. He gets so mad while playing games and rages so hard that decides to *break every single computer/electronic*, from oldest to newest even (chronological order)! So he ends up going against these personified machines.

Along this rampage venture,

In this project, one player plays as Rager and the other player plays the computer.
The computer is actually a crazy virus that can manipulate the electronics with electricity and electromagnets.
(if you couldn't tell: its hands are speakers, the torso is made of old CPU boxes, the legs are keyboards, and the wheels are actually CDs)
Mainly based off of Windows XP, but is generally meant to represent Beige Boxes.
